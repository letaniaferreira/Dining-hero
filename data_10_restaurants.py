Always very enjoyable, and mind-expanding. Tend to enjoy the sweets a little more than the savory, but both sections of the menu are creative and interesting. The new makeover doesn't quite hit the mark, IMO - still too many hard surfaces resulting in the dining room still being a little noisy. It helps to think of this as an entertainment experience because the volume of food isn't quite large enough to constitute a full meal. A little snack afterward always hits the spot."], 5: [u'Atelier Crenn is the best restaurant I\'ve dined at in SF; and will likely remain so. Aside from Dominique Crenn earning the much deserved Best Female Chef in the World title, her flagship restaurant exemplifies peak culinary mastery. With an intimate and boutique dining room buzzing with service, Crenn offers a culinary experience that makes you believe you are somewhere else. The food service is an exquisite balance of art, seasonally optimal ingredients and flavor. The wine service is nothing short of incredible, offering bespoke pairings and variety to suit all pallets. I was recently asked if the experience was worth the investment. My answer was an undoubtedly "Yes." If you are considering a two or three star Michelin restaurant, Atelier Crenn should be at the the top of your list for SF, and the Bay Area. ', u'Easily the best meal of my life. Brilliant chefs, comfortable decor, knowledgeable staff, wonderfully paced courses. Obviously great food and wine, but they also had a surprisingly awesome coffee selection too.', u"We anticipated that this would be an artful experience, but we didn't expect that every bite of food would be more delicious than any other bite in our lives. The food is sublime. The presentation is gallery style art. The experience is unique and unrivaled. This is not a restaurant -- its a gallery of taste and feeling. We chose this restaurant because we are eating our way through the restaurants of Chef's Table Season 1 -- and Atelier Crenn is in a class by itself.  If you are searching for perfection in a restaurant experience, this is it.", u"We were the first guests to complete the new tasting menu in the remodeled space. I expect to see a third Michelin star in the near future, but that's not why you should go. You will experience two tasting menus, a savory and a sweet. The first tasting menu is extremely well balanced and, light, and full bodied all at once. However, the highlight of the experience is the desert course. It's another tasting of its own, and it is also well balanced, light, and full bodied. You will not be served a typical end of course desert that might be heavy or chewy, or light and sugary, but instead it's a whole new experience, one that might change how fine dining approaches the last course.\n\nTo some degree it reminds me of how Gen, the cocktail bar in Tokyo, is approaching cocktails in the form of a tasting menu. Well done Atelier Crenn."]}|location:3127 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94123, USA|open_hours:[u'Monday: Closed', u'Tuesday: 5:00 \u2013 10:00 PM', u'Wednesday: 5:00 \u2013 10:00 PM', u'Thursday: 5:00 \u2013 10:00 PM', u'Friday: 5:00 \u2013 10:00 PM', u'Saturday: 5:00 \u2013 10:00 PM', u'Sunday: Closed']

The cornmeal crust is perfect every time, fresh ingredients make for a very delicious deep dish pizza. The spicy baked chicken wings are so friggin delicious.

The glasses and silverware were not clean. I still highly recommend Little Star, hopefully they pick up the service and cleanliness.', u"Great pizza and atmosphere! Expensive but worth it considering the quality. My only reason for them losing a star is the lack of toppings: $3 for each extra topping on a large and we got 7 pieces of garlic, 4 little spots of goat cheese, and 10 leaves of arugula for a total of $9 extra. In the end our 1 large cost $42 and every piece didn't even have several of the toppings we ordered... making every bite different (and not in a good way). Please be more consistent...

Lines here get ridiculously long during peak lunch hours, but just come before noon and you'll be fine. They have a great variety of choices on their menu.

It took 15 min for my food to come out. A little on the slow side, but still bearable. They have a great outdoor seating area, and there's often live music playing nearby. Great vibe!\n\nAs for food, I got the Texas Burger (without jalapenos), and it was delicious! Loved the avocado and cheese combination, and the meat was cooked perfectly as well.

I'll certainly give them another shot, next time I'm in town", u"If you are wandering around the Embarcadero near the Ferry Building and are looking for a bite to eat, Gott's may be a good option. It's mainly about burgers and fries and stuff that goes with burgers and fries (salads, beer, shakes, ...). They have a lot of burger options and even have a pretty good veggie patty.
