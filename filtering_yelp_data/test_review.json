Motel1One is nearby and a easy two minute walk, slightly uphill towards the castle from the station. \n\nOn entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.\n\nI sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under Â£10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.\n\nSome hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.\n\nHmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. Great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required.\n\nMaybe next time I will endeavour to try food against technology!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}
