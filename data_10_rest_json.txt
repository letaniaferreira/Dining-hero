Light sauce, too, but plenty of salt (could be less).  My dining companions had curries that looked pretty good and they said they enjoyed them.  Prices were reasonable.",

I went know Jan. 3, 2018, And each dish (non-desert) was fish. This was underwhelming at best, and actually disappointing. Yes, the dishes were thoughtful and well executed, but I would have liked to have experienced more of her skills with other type of proteins. Also, one plate was a fish cake with some gel in the middle. It was so fishy that it blew out my palate.",

I've watched the documentary, I enjoyed making friends with the staff and I loved that Dominique Crenn came out to chat to us several times. I wanted to love this meal. But I can't quite bring myself to recommend somebody go.\n\nThe food was creative but hit or miss - a few courses were oddly sour and acidic. There were highlights too - the cider aperitif was lovely and surprising, the steak great and desserts we're some of the best I've had in a tasting menu. The bread was also incredible.\n\nSomething didn't add up though. The desserts - traditional Mexican themed - didn't fit at all with the rest of the menu and felt like a bolt-on. There was nothing tying the menu together aside from a poem that was quickly forgotten about.\n\nI would recommend this place if the price was lower. But when you're paying that much, and you set the expectations that high, then you've got to deliver. And the food fell short.",
