Then they changed the name,  raised the prices considerably and stopped staying open late but kept the same crappy food and menu. Now it is just a tourist trap. I do not know any locals that still go there. Here for an early dinner on a Friday night, the place filled up before we were done.  Had the pad thai.  Nice mild sauce, zero spice (as I like it!).  Light sauce, too, but plenty of salt (could be less).  My dining companions had curries that looked pretty good and they said they enjoyed them.  Prices were reasonable. Really nice, pretty good value too. A glass of wine for $5 in San Francisco is not something you find everyday. Haight-Ashbury Thai fusion. Perfect. Clean , yummy, beautiful people, beautiful service. Not too spicy unless you ask. So good! The Hippie Special is fantastic. Good spice!')
# doc = nlp(u'Third or fourth time here. Always very enjoyable, and mind-expanding. Tend to enjoy the sweets a little more than the savory, but both sections of the menu are creative and interesting. The new makeover does not quite hit the mark, IMO - still too many hard surfaces resulting in the dining room still being a little noisy. It helps to think of this as an entertainment experience because the volume of food is not quite large enough to constitute a full meal. A little snack afterward always hits the spot. Atelier Crenn is the best restaurant I have dined at in SF; and will likely remain so. Aside from Dominique Crenn earning the much deserved Best Female Chef in the World title, her flagship restaurant exemplifies peak culinary mastery. With an intimate and boutique dining room buzzing with service, Crenn offers a culinary experience that makes you believe you are somewhere else. The food service is an exquisite balance of art, seasonally optimal ingredients and flavor. The wine service is nothing short of incredible, offering bespoke pairings and variety to suit all pallets. I was recently asked if the experience was worth the investment. My answer was an undoubtedly Yes. If you are considering a two or three star Michelin restaurant, Atelier Crenn should be at the the top of your list for SF, and the Bay Area. Brilliant chefs, comfortable decor, knowledgeable staff, wonderfully paced courses. Obviously great food and wine, but they also had a surprisingly awesome coffee selection too. Atelier Crenn was one of many stops on a ten day SF - LA food trip, and probably the most anticipated. Let me start by saying the food was incredible - there was so much love and attention to detail in every bite I never wanted it to end. I loved the Japanese elements used in the savoury courses, the tomato melon trout row and the caviar kohlrabi koji was a stand out for me. In addition to the delicate food, it was lovely to hear the little stories of what inspired the dishes and match them to a line of poetry which was presented to us before the meal began. The Mayan inspired desserts were fantastic, especially the masa crisp. It truly shows that the pastry chef and chef have been a team for seven years. We chose the non-alcoholic pairing which was unique and well thought out; not overally sweet, just like the desserts. The space was comfortable and the servers were polite and knowledgeable. I was thrilled to get the chance to walk through the kitchen with Dominique and meet her team. She is a genuinely passionate person, as were all the other staff, and I truly had the feeling that they were happy to have each guest dining with them. I would highly recommend Atelier Crenn and can not wait to return to be wowed again. 2 stars cannot describe my experience here. Thank you for the excellent meal. We anticipated that this would be an artful experience, but we did not expect that every bite of food would be more delicious than any other bite in our lives. The food is sublime. The presentation is gallery style art. The experience is unique and unrivaled. This is not a restaurant -- its a gallery of taste and feeling. We chose this restaurant because we are eating our way through the restaurants of Chef Table Season 1 -- and Atelier Crenn is in a class by itself.  If you are searching for perfection in a restaurant experience, this is it.')
