Expensive but worth it considering the quality. My only reason for them losing a star is the lack of toppings: $3 for each extra topping on a large and we got 7 pieces of garlic, 4 little spots of goat cheese, and 10 leaves of arugula for a total of $9 extra. In the end our 1 large cost $42 and every piece didn't even have several of the toppings we ordered... making every bite different (and not in a good way). Please be more consistent...

The cornmeal crust is perfect every time, fresh ingredients make for a very delicious deep dish pizza. The spicy baked chicken wings are so friggin delicious. Any other time I would give Little Star five stars, but the service was not very good, kept having to ask for my water to be refilled when it was not busy at all. The glasses and silverware were not clean. I still highly recommend Little Star, hopefully they pick up the service and cleanliness.', 'name': u'Ted Eicher'}], 5: [{'password': 1506798744, 'user_review': u"Unreal.
